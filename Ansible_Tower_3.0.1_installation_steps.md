## Ansible Tower 3.0.1 installation

This is a quickstart reference of the commands needed to install and configure Ansible Tower. 


### Installation

**NOTE** These steps are specific to CentOS/RHEL

Install EPEL repository

```yum install -y http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm```

Download Tower

```wget https://releases.ansible.com/awx/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz```

Extract Tower

```tar zxvf ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz```

Switch to Ansible Tower directory

```cd ansible-tower-setup*```

Edit inventory file 

```vi inventory```

Below is an example inventory file, make sure to update the password values. 

```yaml
[primary]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[secondary]

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password='password'
redis_password='password'

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password='password'
```
Ansible requires ssh access to the hosts it will be managing.  

Generate an SSH key

```ssh-keygen```

Hit enter to accept defaults

Add ssh key to authorized_keys file

```cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys```

Setup permissions

```chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys```

Now ssh to localhost and accept the fingerprint

```ssh localhost```


Now we are ready to run the setup script

```./setup.sh```

After setup has completed successfully you will get the following message:

> The setup process completed successfully.
> 
Setup log saved to /var/log/tower/setup-2016-08-04-13:15:37.log
